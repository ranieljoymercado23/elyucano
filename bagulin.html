        <p>The marker of the 360 lineal meters Anduyan Bridge along Anduyan-Rizal-San Pascual-Nangalesan-Asin Road was unveiled
            near approach "B" after which Secretary Villar with DPWH Region I Director Ronnel M. Tan, Department of Tourism

        <h2>ALABOK BURIAL CAVE (KEDLAP)</h2>
        <img src="image/kedlap_cave.png" alt="">
        <p>The Kedlap Burial Cave is a shallow cave overlooking the distant northern mountains where a natural ledge of stones
            serves as a resting place of the coffin and its accessories. Aside from the coffin, we also saw some offerings
            consisting of spears, a flute, a jar, deer antlers, an old outdated five peso bill, and even a bottle of Gin which
            denotes that all of which were placed recently and must have been jumbled with the old ones if there were any. The one
            that got your attention was the wood coffin with a cover shaped into a carabao (water buffalo). it has a rounded body,
            a head at one end and a tail at the other.</p>
