            means bird's nest. Cesar, the owner of the Art Gallery related that when he was a young boy, he loved going to the
            mountains to look for "umok". When he found these umok, he loved looking what were inside the umok. Finding some birds
            or eggs, he returned them just the same to the trees where he got them. Ciano was the name of his grandfather. He was
            popular among the barangay folks because he was a good cook. Cesar looked exactly like his grandfather. He always heard
            comments from the local folks that he was like "Ciano". He named his art gallery in honor of his late grandfather.
